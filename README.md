Herein lies the frontend code for The Registry

### Welcome to TheRegistry: Secure and Seamless Document Management

#### Built for the ETHOnline 2023 hackathon.

At TheRegistry, we're transforming the way documents are issued and managed, making the process secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Say goodbye to traditional paper documents and complex blockchain interactions. With our platform, you can effortlessly request and access your digital documents.

### Key Features:

**Streamlined User Experience**: We've integrated Lit protocol to provide a seamless experience. You can generate decentralized keys linked to your Gmail address, eliminating the need for complex tools like MetaMask.

**Gasless Transactions**: Enjoy gas-free interactions, whether you're an Issuer or a User. No more worries about transaction fees.

**Cost-Efficiency**: Our deployment on the Polygon network means you benefit from lower transaction fees, making document management more affordable.

**Twitter Authenticity**: We ensure the authenticity of Issuers through zero-knowledge proofs. Only the genuine Twitter account owner can issue and verify documents.

**Data Security**: We use Tableland, a web3-native database, to store your profile information, document requests, and issued documents. Your data is in safe hands.

**Document Encryption**: Lit protocol not only streamlines the process but also secures your documents. Only designated Users can decrypt and access the documents issued to them.

Join us in the future of document management. [Sign up today](https://the-registry.vercel.app/) and experience a new level of simplicity and security.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
